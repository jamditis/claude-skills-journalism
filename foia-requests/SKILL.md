# FOIA and public records requests

Comprehensive guide for obtaining government records through freedom of information laws.

## Understanding FOIA landscape

### Jurisdiction overview

| Level | Law | Scope |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Federal | Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552) | Federal executive branch agencies |
| State | Varies by state (e.g., OPRA in NJ, FOIL in NY) | State and local agencies |
| Local | Often covered by state law | Municipal, county, school boards |

### Key federal exemptions (U.S. Federal FOIA)

```markdown
## The 9 federal FOIA exemptions

1. **National security** - Classified information
2. **Internal personnel rules** - Agency housekeeping matters
3. **Statutory exemptions** - Other laws prohibit disclosure
4. **Trade secrets** - Confidential business information
5. **Inter/intra-agency memos** - Deliberative process privilege
6. **Personal privacy** - Personnel, medical files
7. **Law enforcement** - Could interfere with proceedings
8. **Financial institutions** - Bank examination reports
9. **Geological data** - Oil and gas well information

Note: Agencies must segregate and release non-exempt portions
```

## State public records laws

All 50 states have enacted laws requiring certain government records to be open to the public. 

### State-specific resources

```

### Common state examptions
State legislatures may be subject to different rules than the rest of their governing bodies:

1. **Exempt from public records statute** (e.g., Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Oregon, Wyoming)
2. **Excluded from definition of public body** (e.g., Georgia, Minnesota)
3. **Covered by separate statute** (e.g., California)
4. **Allowed to set own policies** (e.g., Mississippi, New York)

Court decisions and attorneys general opinions in some states have held that the separation of powers doctrine prevents courts from enforcing public records statutes against the legislature.

## Drafting effective requests

### Request template (Federal FOIA)

```markdown
[NAMES]
[ADDRESS]
[CITY],[STATE] [ZIPCODE]
[EMAIL]
[PHONE]

[DATE]

FOIA Officer
[AGENCY]
[AGENCY_ADDRESS]

[STATUTE] Request

Dear FOIA Officer:

My name is [NAME] and I am a [TITLE] for [OUTLET]. Pursuant to the [STATUTE], I am writing to request the following:

- [RECORDS_REQUESTED1] between [START_DATE] to [END_DATE] from [SPECIFIC_OFFICES] including the following words/phrases [KEYWORD1], [KEYWORD2], [KEYWORD3], [KEYWORD4] 
- [RECORDS_REQUESTED2] between [START_DATE] to [END_DATE] from [SPECIFIC_OFFICES] including the following words/phrases [KEYWORD1], [KEYWORD2], [KEYWORD3], [KEYWORD4] 
- [RECORDS_REQUESTED3] between [START_DATE] to [END_DATE] from [SPECIFIC_OFFICES] including the following words/phrases [KEYWORD1], [KEYWORD2], [KEYWORD3], [KEYWORD4] 

**INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING SEARCH:**
1. Instructions Regarding "Leads":
As required by the relevant case law, [AGENCY] should follow any leads it discovers during the conduct of its searches and perform additional searches when said leads indicate that records may be located in another system. Failure to follow clear leads is a violation of [STATUTE].

2. Request for Public Records:
Please search for any records even if they are already publicly available.

3. Request Regarding Attachments, Photographs and Other Visual Materials:
I request that any photographs or other visual materials responsive to my request be released to me in their original or comparable forms, quality and resolution. For example, if a photograph was taken digitally, or if [AGENCY] maintains a photograph digitally, I request disclosure of the original digital image file, not a reduced resolution version of that image file nor a printout and scan of that image file.

Likewise, if a photograph was originally taken as a color photograph, I request disclosure of that photograph as a color image, not a black and white image. 

For video and audio files I request that they be provided in their complete, original and unedited format. 

Please contact me at the number or email listed below for any clarification on these points.

4. Request for Duplicate Pages:
l request disclosure of any and all supposedly "duplicate" pages. Scholars analyze records not only for the information available on any given page, but also for the relationships between that information and information on pages surrounding it. As such, though certain pages may have been previously released to me, the existence of those pages within new context renders them functionally new pages. As such, the only way to properly analyze released information is to analyze that information within its proper context. Therefore, I request disclosure of all "duplicate" pages.

5. Request for Search of Records Transferred to Other Agencies:
I request that in conducting its search, [AGENCY] should disclose releasable records even if they are available publicly through other sources outside the [AGENCY] office. If [AGENCY] is unable to do so, it should disclose where specifically the relevant records are available.

6. Regarding Destroyed Records
If any records responsive or potentially responsive to my request have been destroyed, my request includes, but is not limited to, any and all records relating or referring to the destruction of those records. This includes, but is not limited to, any and all records relating or referring to the events leading to the destruction of those records.

INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING SCOPE AND BREADTH OF REQUESTS
Please interpret the scope of this request broadly. [AGENCY] is instructed to interpret the scope of this request in the most liberal manner possible short of an interpretation that would lead to a conclusion that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought.

EXEMPTIONS AND SEGREGABILITY
I call your attention to a 21 January 2009 Memorandum concerning the Freedom of Information Act, in which the President states: 
All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA 
[ .... ] The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA.

In the same Memorandum, he added that government information should not be kept confidential "merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears.''

Finally, the President ordered that "The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption: In the case of doubt, openness prevails."

Nonetheless, if any responsive record or portion thereof is claimed to be exempt from production, FOIA statutes provide that even if some of the requested material is properly exempt from mandatory disclosure, all segregable portions must be released. If documents are denied in part or in whole, please specify which exemption(s) is (are) claimed for each passage or whole document denied. 

Please provide a complete itemized inventory and a detailed factual justification of total or partial denial of documents. Specify the number of pages in each document and the total number of pages pertaining to this request. For "classified" material denied, please include the following
information: the classification (confidential, secret or top secret); identity of the classifier; date or event for automatic declassification or classification review or downgrading; if applicable, identity of official authorizing extension of automatic declassification or review past six years; and, if applicable, the reason for extended classification beyond six years.

In excising material, please "black out" the material rather than "white out" or "cut out." I expect, as provided by FOIA, that the remaining non-exempt portions of documents will be released.

Please release all pages regardless of the extent of excising, even if all that remains are the stationary headings or administrative markings.

In addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to release records which may be technically exempt, but where withholding serves no important public interest.


**Format requested:**
I request that any releases stemming from this request be provided to me in its original digital format (soft-copy), ideally through an online file transfer or digital portal system. Should this be impossible, material may be provided on a compact disk, flash drive, hard drive or other like media.

I request that you provide records as they become available, rather than all at once.

Please produce all records with administrative markings and pagination included.

Please send a memo (copy to me) to the appropriate units in your office to assure that no records related to this request are destroyed. Please advise of any destruction of records and include the date of and authority for such destruction.


**Fee waiver request (for U.S. federal FOIA):**
I am an [JOB_TITLE] for [CURRENT_OUTLET] covering a wide-range of issues. My reporting has been published in [PRIOR_OUTLETS] and other outlets.

I am willing to pay any reasonable expenses, up to $[AMOUNT], associated with this request, however, as the purpose of the requested disclosure is in full conformity with the statutory requirements for a waiver of fees, I formally request such a waiver. I request a waiver of all costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §552(a }( 4 HA)( iii l ("Documents shall be furnished without any charge ... if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester ... ). Disclosure in this case meets the statutory criteria. and a foe waiver would fulfill Congress’s legislative intent in amending FOIA. Sec Judicial Watch. Inc. v. Rossotti. 326 F.3d 1309. 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) ("Congress amended FOIA to ensure that it be liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters.""). I incorporate by reference the explanation and attached materials in the above sections which demonstrates why the requested information is in the public interest.

Should my request for a fee waiver be denied, I request that I be categorized as a member of the news media for fee purposes pursuant to DoJ 5400.7-R C6.l.5.7. According to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4l(A)(ii), which codified the ruling of Nat'I Security Archive v. Dept of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381 (D.C. Cir. 1989). the term "a representative of the news media" means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public. Uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. 

If the fee waiver is denied, I also request that all charges be itemized in writing.

As the legislative history of FOIA reveals, it is critical that the phrase 'representative of the news media' be broadly interpreted if the act is to work as expected .... In fact, any person or organization which regularly publishes or disseminates information to the public … should qualit:y for waivers as a ·representative of the news media."' 132 Cong. Rec. SI 4298 ( daily ed. Sept. 30. 1986) (emphasis in original quotation); and 2) ''A request by a reporter or other person affiliated with a newspaper. magazine. television or radio station, or other entity that is in the business of publishing or otherwise disseminating information to the public qualifies under this provision.'' 132 Cong. Rec. I 19463 ( Oct. 8. I 986) ( emphasis in original quotation) J. Therefore, in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and relevant case law, I, Arijit Sen, should be considered a representative of the news media.

I have the intent and ability to disseminate this significant expansion of public understanding of government operations. The public interest presented in this case far outweighs any commercial interest of my own in the requested release. For these reasons and based upon their extensive elaboration above, I request a full waiver of fees be granted. 

I will appeal any denial of my request for a waiver administratively and to the courts if necessary.

**Expedited processing request (if applicable):**
I request expedited processing because:
- [Urgent need to inform the public about actual or alleged government activity]
- [Imminent threat to life or physical safety]

As a reminder [TIME_LIMIT_STATUTE] requries a response with [DAYS_NUMBER] days.

**Contact information:**
Please do not hesitate to contact me at [EMAIL] or [PHONE] if you have questions or need clarification about this request.

Thank you. I appreciate your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

### Request drafting best practices

```markdown
## Effective request strategies

### Be specific but not too narrow
BAD: "All documents about climate change"
BAD: "The email from John Smith on March 15, 2024 at 2:47 PM"
GOOD: "Emails between [Office] and [External Party] regarding [Topic] from [Date Range]"

### Use agency terminology
- Research how agency categorizes information
- Use their document type names (memos, briefings, reports)
- Reference specific programs or initiatives by official name
- Include relevant file numbers if known

### Define your terms
- Specify what you mean by "communications" (emails, texts, calls?)
- Define "records" (include drafts? attachments?)
- Clarify "regarding" vs "mentioning" vs "primarily about"

### Request specific record types
- Emails and email attachments
- Text messages and messaging apps
- Printed Correspondence (letters, faxes)
- Calendar entries and meeting invites
- Memoranda, briefing papers and presentations
- Contracts, purchase orders and invoices
- Meeting minutes and notes
- Policies and procedures
- Databases and datasets; schema for databases/datsets

```

4. **Comparison**: Similar requests have received fee waivers. See: [examples if available]

I request the fee waiver be granted or, alternatively, that fees be limited to [amount].

Sincerely,
[Name]
```

- [ ] Request description accurate
- [ ] All requested record types addressed

### Completeness assessment
- [ ] All date ranges covered?
- [ ] All offices/divisions searched?
- [ ] Search terms used listed?
- [ ] Any referrals to other agencies?

### Exemption analysis
For each exemption claimed:
- [ ] Specific exemption cited (e.g., "Exemption 6")

```

### Redaction analysis

```markdown
## Understanding redactions

### Types of redactions
- (b)(1) - National security [black bar with exemption]
- (b)(5) - Deliberative process [often overused]
- (b)(6) - Personal privacy [names, contact info]
- (b)(7)(A) - Law enforcement investigation
- (b)(7)(C) - Law enforcement privacy

### Challenging over-redaction
Questions to ask:
1. Is entire document withheld or just portions?
2. Are routine details redacted unnecessarily?
3. Is information already public elsewhere?
4. Is the exemption correctly applied?
5. Was foreseeable harm test applied?

### Building your case
- Compare with similar released documents
- Check if information is already public
- Note inconsistent redaction patterns
- Document segregability arguments
```

RE: Administrative Appeal of FOIA Request [Tracking Number]

Dear Appeals Officer:

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6), I appeal the [partial denial / full denial / inadequate search / fee waiver denial] of my FOIA request dated [original date], tracking number [number].

**Original request:**
[Brief description of what you requested]

**Agency response:**
On [date], the agency [describe response - denied, partially released, etc.]

- [Foreseeable harm not demonstrated]

**2. Inadequate search**
The agency failed to conduct an adequate search because:
- [Specific offices not searched]

**3. Failure to segregate**
The agency failed to release non-exempt portions as required. Specifically:
- [Identify documents where segregation possible]

**4. Fee waiver improperly denied**

## Advanced strategies

### Multi-agency requests

```markdown
## Coordinated request strategy

When a topic spans multiple agencies:

1. **Map the agencies involved**
   - Which agencies have jurisdiction?
   - Which offices within agencies?
   - Are there inter-agency communications?

2. **Sequence requests strategically**
   - Start with agency most likely to release

   - Note discrepancies in redactions
   - Use one agency's release to challenge another's withholding

4. **Track coordination**
   - Document all request/response dates
   - Note referrals between agencies
   - Build timeline of events from multiple sources
