# CCM brand notes

## Writing style

- Always use sentence case for headings (never title case)
- Use the Oxford comma
- Prefer em dashes (—) with spaces on both sides
- First reference: "Center for Cooperative Media"
- Subsequent references: "the Center" (external) or "CCM" (internal only)

## Color usage

- Use CCM Red (#CA3553) as primary accent
- Black (#000000) for headlines and primary text
- Avoid pure white backgrounds on cover pages - use cream (#faf9f7)
- Red is for accents, highlights, and CTAs - not for large text blocks

## Logo placement

- Logo appears in top right of cover pages
- Include parent organization (Montclair State University) on formal documents
- Use text-based logo mark when image logo unavailable

## Document footers

Always include:
- "Center for Cooperative Media • Montclair State University"
- Page numbers on multi-page documents
